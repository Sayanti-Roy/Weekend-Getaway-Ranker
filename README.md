# 🗺️ Weekend Getaway Ranker (Task 4)

## Overview
**Weekend Getaway Ranker** is a data engineering recommendation engine designed to suggest the best travel destinations based on a user's source city. It uses a **Weighted Scoring Algorithm** to rank locations by balancing travel distance, visitor ratings, and popularity.

This project fulfills the **Task 4** requirements of the internship assessment, utilizing **Python**, **Pandas**, and **GeoPy** for geospatial calculations.

## 🚀 Features
1.  **Smart Recommendation Engine:** Ranks destinations based on a composite score.
2.  **Geospatial Calculation:** Uses `geodesic` distance (in km) to filter locations within a "Weekend Trip" radius.
3.  **Weighted Algorithm:**
    * **Distance (40%):** Closer locations get higher scores (normalized).
    * **Rating (40%):** Higher-rated places are prioritized.
    * **Popularity (20%):** Places with more reviews get a slight boost.
4.  **Multi-City Support:** Works for any major Indian city (e.g., Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas
* **Geospatial Library:** GeoPy (for accurate distance calculation)
